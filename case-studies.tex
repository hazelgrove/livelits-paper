\section{Case Studies}\label{sec:case-studies}
\subsection{Hazel Overview}\label{sec:hazel-overview}
Brief overview (1/2 page) on Hazel (what do holes look like? structure editing, but not in too much detail,
live evaluation)

\subsection{Live Grading}\label{sec:live-grading}
\subsubsection{Overview}\label{sec:live-grading-overview}
Talk about the scenario

Live matrix: what is a matrix structurally? (data frame? list of lists?) + how does liveness work
+ overview of hygiene guarantees

Grade cutoffs: how does it work wrt liveness? (do we use a parameter here instead of a splice?) -- 
focus on domain-specific benefits here.

\subsection{Image Transformation Pipeline}\label{sec:transformation}
Show example of an image transformation pipeline going through livelits

This might also benefit from Parameterization

Show multiple calls with different example images + closure selector UIs

Go into more detail about how evaluation works + fill-and-resume mechanics (and efficiency nod)

Talk about probes?

\subsection{Additional Examples}\label{sec:additional-examples}
It would be nice to have a gallery-style figure and a brief overview of some other case studies
and how they exercise the novel features of the livelits mechanism. Maybe some statistics on how
many lines of code it took.
